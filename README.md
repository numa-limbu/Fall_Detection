# Fall Detection System using ESP32 and MPU6050

## Overview

This project implements a **Fall Detection System** using an **ESP32 microcontroller** and **MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope** sensor. The system is designed to detect falls in real-time and send immediate alerts, offering an innovative solution for personal safety, especially for the elderly and individuals at risk of falls.

The **ESP32** provides wireless connectivity and processing power, while the **MPU6050** tracks motion and orientation changes, allowing the system to accurately determine if a fall has occurred.

## Features

- Real-time fall detection using MPU6050 sensor data (acceleration and angular velocity).
- Wireless communication using ESP32 to send fall alerts.
- Efficient fall detection algorithm for accurate results.
- Lightweight and low-power design suitable for wearable applications.
